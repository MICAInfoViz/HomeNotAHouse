// Declare variables
given that neighborhoods is an array of neighborhood names, average house values, and average crime rates
given housingPrices is an array of price ranges
given crimeRates is an array of crime rate ranges

// Initialize
Set housing price dropdown menu to lowest value in housingPrices
Set crime rate dropdown menu to highest value in crimeRates

// Cycle through all neighborhoods for housing price matches
for every neighborhood name in neighborhoods
	if average house value is within user selected housingPrice then
		add neighborhood to housePriceOptions

// Cycle through all neighborhoods for crime rate matches
for every neighborhood name in neighborhoods
	if average crime rate is within user selected crimeRate then
		add neighborhood to crimeRateOptions
		
// Determine if there is/are "perfect match(es)"
For every neighborhood name in neighborhoods
	if neighborhood name appears in both housePriceOptions and crimeRateOptions
		display neighborhood name
	else
		display "No perfect matches found, see 3 closest matches" or something


// IF THERE IS NOT A PERFECT MATCH, THIS FUNCTION WILL PRODUCE "3 CLOSEST MATCHES"
// Need to convert crime rates and house prices to an index somehow in order for this to work
For every neighborhood name in neighborhoods
	Subtract user selected housingPrice from actual housing price
		record absolute value of housingPriceDifference
	Subtract user selected crimeRate from actual crime rate
		record absolute value of crimeRateDifference

// Need to create an array of this, but how?
neighborhoodScores = housingPriceDifferences + crimeRateDifferences

// Sort the scores
for every neighborhoodScore in neighborhoodScores
	sort lowest to highest
	select first three = best matches

// Display the results
Get element called "Results"
	write best matches
